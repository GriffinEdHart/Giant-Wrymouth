						<p>The Giant Wrymouth is a species of fish found in the Pacific Northwest. Fondly refered to as a "Potato Head," not much is known about this fish, other than the fact that it is cousins with the Wolf Eel (which, despite its name, is <em>not</em> an actual eel). The only ones in captivity were found on accident while discovery crews were looking for other fish (the story goes that The Seattle Aquarium's <em>Princess</em> swam into the catching net on its own).<br>Other than simply being my favorite fish, I feel a connection to this little opportunistic underdog. This is why I've decided to name my photography business after the Giant Wrymouth!</p>

				<p>Working with me is like a walk in the park - simple and conversational - this is by design, as I believe people look their best when they are relaxed and enjoying themselves! Let me worry about the details and making you look good.</p>

					<p>While I'm a professional photographer, I am also an avid hobbyist. I'm always looking for new and exciting ways to express my creative freedom. As a result, the images I take during these adventures are always available to purchase as a print. I also provide custom print services for client photoshoots.</p>
