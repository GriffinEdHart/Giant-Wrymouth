                <h1>Howdy!</h1>
                <p>My name is Griffin, I'm what you would call a "professional people-person." I love movies, the outdoors, music, and creative expression. As a professional as well as a hobbyist, I always strive for new ways to stretch the limits of art, all while gaining more experience and enjoying myself. In that sense, I see photography as much less than a job and more-so a passion. Feel free to check out my Instagram page for updates on my projects! If any stand out to you, let me know! I'm happy to make custom prints for anyone.<br><br> For over 6 years, I have been passionately taking photos and sharing art with my friends and family. I recently decided to break into the professional photography and printing industry, as I believe I bring something to the table that I don't see in many other photographers.<br>
                I wouldn't offer a service or sell a product that I, myself, wouldn't buy. I also don't believe in charging extra or limiting the amount of pictures during the editing process, these are your pictures, why shouldn't you have them?<br><br>
                One of the aspects of family and portrait photography that I see is missed is the human element - staged photos are obviously great if that's a style you're going for, but in my experience, my clients and friends prefer the candid shots I take. I believe that a photography session should be relaxed, conversational, and (most importantly) fun! If it's not fun, why bother?<br><br>If you're on the lookout for a portrait, family, or event photographer, I hope you give me a chance to show you what it's like to work with me.</p>
